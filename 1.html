<h2>FOOTBALL</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football" target="_blank" title="football">Association football, more commonly known as <u><strong>football</strong></u> or <u><strong>soccer</strong></u>,
[a] is a team sport</a> played with a spherical ball between two
teams of 11 players. It is played by approximately 250 million
players in over 200 countries and dependencies,
making it the world's most popular sport.
The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch
with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to
outscore the opposition by moving the ball beyond the
goal line into the opposing goal. The team with
the higher number of goals wins the game.</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as
the Laws of the Game. The ball is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in
circumference and known as the football. The two teams each
compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between
the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team
that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner;
if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then
the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has
only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of
the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss prior to
kick-off or penalty kicks.[4]</p>
